whisper did well on transcription. It was interesting that the AI system got most of the words right in the video. I had a video with more than one speaker and could not tell the difference between the people. Whisper got all of the words right in the Lam watch UMD video. Whisper did not pick up on the background music. 
it was shocking that it was to get Lutz's name spelled right. it was shocking because it is a Jewish last name so you would think it would get it wrong. 
I did get one thing wrong for my second video at the end. it said Go Turks, not Go Terps. it is a simple word so you would think it would get it right.
