whisper did well on transcription. It was interesting that it was getting everything right. I had a video with more than one speaker and could not tell the difference between 
the people. 
it was shocked that it was to get Lutz's name spelled right. it was shocking because it is a Jewish last name so you would think it would get it wrong. 
I did get one thing wrong for my second video at the end. it said Go Turks, not Go Terps. it is a simple word so you would think it would get it right.
